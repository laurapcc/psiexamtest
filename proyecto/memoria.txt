PROJECT and APPLICATION
First of all, I created the project ----- and the application ----- and registered the application in the settings file.


DATABASE
I created the database with the following command: 'createdb -U alumnodb -h localhost ----examendb---' and I changed the DATABASE 
variable in setting.py just as we did during this course.


MODELS
I created the models following the pdf provided and creating the relationships between them when needed.
AAA --foreign key --> BBB
AAA --foreign key --> BBB

I register each f these models in the app's admin file so that the admin and then I make the migration with 
django commands (python3 manage.py makemigrations and python3 manage.py migrate). Now if I visit https://127.0.0.1:8001/admin
and I login with our superuser (previously created) I can see that the admin has full control over the models.


---POPULATE.py---
I created ---populate.py--- in the directory ----app--/management/commands and created a new command '---populate---'.
In its handle I created some objects of the the type ---model1--, ---model2--- and then checked from the admin site that
the had been correctly created.
